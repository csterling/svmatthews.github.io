    <h2>Seattle Children's - SMAHRT Website</h2>
    <p>The SMAHRTeam, Social Media and Adolescent Health Research Team, asked to have a <a href="http://www.smahrtresearch.com/">website</a> put together that was made for doctors and parents alike. Designing a site for two audiences is a difficult task. The site focuses on simple navigation to information but also exploration of the information. Its design is professional and enjoyable. SMAHRT are great clients and I am still making updates to this website as they produce more publications and give more presentations.</p>

  <li class="project design">
    <h2>There are several mountains</h2>
    <p>This is a quick project of mine to experiment with different typefaces and see how a variety of styles can work together towards a common theme. The quote is a simple translation I ran into during work. There is a tendency to choose one or two typefaces in projects in order to keep things straightforward for the viewer. This isnâ€™t a bad philosophy to design by. Having too many different styles can make a graphic too complex and overwhelming to the eyes. See the <a href="http://giscollective.org/typeface-experiment/">full post</a>.</p>

    <h2>Land Tenure Publication</h2>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.nelson.wisc.edu/ltc/publications.php">Land Tenure Center</a> of the University of Wisconsin-Madison aimed to put together a professional publication of reports and papers discussing land tenure and carbon usage around the world. I manged the full-scale publication from design concept to print. The 120+ pages required intense organization and collaboration. All maps and graphics created and edited by myself and the UW-Madison Cartography Lab.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.wisconsinedgeproject.blogspot.com/">The Wisconsin EDGE Project</a> is a student organizatio that I was Co-Director of for the 2011/2012 academic year. We had many ongoing projects that all requried some sort of design or presentation. It was our goal to give a visual identity to the organization through its design as well as through it's writing. These are some of examples of the work I put together. Besides design, I filmed and edited videos for the organization that can be seen on the edge <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/WisconsinEDGEproject">youtube page</a>.</p>
